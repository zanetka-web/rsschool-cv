### About me:

I am a mother of two wonderful children. I have always liked to grow and learn new things, so over the past two years I have been intensively absorbing knowledge about photography. It was a great experience that made me feel like a motivated and creative person. My husband is one of the best programmers and he suggested that I try to learn programming. After the first tutorials, I already knew it was something for me.

### Goals:

Since I started learning the basics for about 2 months, I would like to deepen my knowledge of javaScript so that I can work on projects in the future, create my own applications and learn new things related to it.
